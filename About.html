    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="AboutText">Hi! My name is Luca and I make music as “Maydust”. You are probably either here because you
        already know who I am
        and now want to see what’s on my website, in which case I will now say: “Welcome and enjoy your stay”, or you
        just found out who I am and now want to see what I have already made thus far. If this is why you are here, then
        I will now say: “Welcome and enjoy your stay”.
        <br> <br>
        :)
        <br> <br>
        But now something about me: I am 17 years old and live in Germany. I really like the smell of forests and wood
        or the sound of a crackling fireplace (thats quite ironic honestly) or autumn leaves in the wind. <br> I started
        to
        play the piano when I was nine years old. I liked playing it a lot, but I never really enjoyed playing things
        other people made, so I tried to compose my own music. This was, at first, very frustrating, as I didn’t know
        anything about how to do something like that. So I tried to get over it and to learn things other people made
        nevertheless, which did not work out very well, because I basically never learned any song from start to finish.
        So then, 5 years ago, I started to play the organ. This was very much fun as well, especially when my teacher
        started to talk about improvising with me. This is also what I do now. I improvise. 3 years ago I finally
        started to produce my own music, which, at first, was very electronic and bad (but still improvised). Gradually,
        it became more and more artistically nuanced though and slowly started to evolve into the music I make now. My
        current style of music is influenced by musicians like Tyler Joseph, AnnenMayKantereit and Ren. If you
        do not know these musicians, go check them out. They make amazing music. If you want to listen to more of the
        music I make, then click on your preferred streaming service (logo) at the top of this website. If you want to
        support what I do, I would be grateful if you would follow me on social media.
        Simply listening to my music is still the best way to support, though, and I would be happy if you enjoyed the
        music I made! <br><br>

        But enough about me. Now what about you? If you have any questions, ideas, or got anything else to say,
        hit me up on Instagram! Looking forward to talking with you. <br>

        Now, enjoy your stay and I hope you won’t leave too soon :) <br>
        Yours, <br>
        Maydust
